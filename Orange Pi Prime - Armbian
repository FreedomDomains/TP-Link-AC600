Directions for installing the TP-Link AC600 USB wifi adapter on Orange Pi Prime running Armbian OS:  

  These directions include compiling a driver for the USB, and it is very important to make sure you have the EXACT linux-headers
  to match the architecture of your board and OS.  If the correct headers are not available anywhere, I would suggest buying a new
  micro sd card, and installing a version of Armbian that does have the correct headers available.  The instructions start there, but
  if you already have Armbian running and can verify that you will be able to install the correct headers you can skip to step 

  It is assumed you have the software tools to format the micro sd, to burn the Armbian image onto the sd, ssh to access the board,
  and 7-zip for windows.  I used a windows laptop to download and burn the image and access the ssh into the Orange Pi, but the        directions would be similar for other OS's.


1.  Go to:

  https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-prime

  Scroll down to Armbian Stretch section and click on direct download.  A pop up box will ask if you want to download.
  Check and make sure the name of the file ends in "Debian_stretch_next_4.19.20.7z" The 4.19.20 part is important because the
  version of Armbian that you download must be one that has linux-headers available for download for the EXACT same version.

  Click "ok" in the dialog box, and the file will be saved to your downloads folder (this is a large file, may take a few minutes)

  If you are seeing a version more recent than 4.19.20, cancel the download and go to:

  https://dl.armbian.com/orangepiprime/archive

  locate the link: Armbian_5.75_Orangepiprime_Debian_stretch_next_4.19.20.7z, double click on it and save it to your downloads folder

2.  Go into download folder and locate the file. RIGHT click on it and a menu will come up. 
   Select 7-zip > extract to Armbian_5.75_Orangepiprime_Debian_stretch_next_4.19.20
   A folder will be created with that LONG name.  Click on the folder and locate a file named              "Armbian_5.75_Orangepiprime_Debian_stretch_next_4.19.20.img"
   You won't do anything with the file quite yet.  You just want to make sure it is there and you can find it.

3. Open the balenaEtcher software (it should be on your desktop with the "show icon")  Click "select image" Navigate to your downloads
   folder, find "Armbian_5.75_Orangepiprime_Debian_stretch_next_4.19.20.img", select it and click "Open"  Make sure that the second        option in the balenaEtcher screen shows your micro sd card. If everything looks right, go ahead and click "Flash!"  Insert your 
   mico sd into your Orange Pi.

4. SSH into your Orange Pi Prime as root. The default root password for Armbian is "1234".  You will need to change that to a password      of your choice.

   check running processes to see if Network Manager is on the list:

   root@orangepiprime:~# ps -aux
   
   Network Manager interferes with the proper functioning of the wifi driver you are about to install, so it needs to be disabled. 
   First you need to add your "eth0" interface to "/etc/network/interfaces":

   root@orangepiprime:~# cd /etc/network
   root@orangepiprime:/etc/network# cp interfaces interfaces.orig
   root@orangepiprime:/etc/network# nano interfaces

   Inside the file you will see:

   auto lo
   iface lo inet loopback

   That should stay there. If you have specified a static IP for the Orange Pi in your
   router, add this stanza, changing the example IP addresses below to the correct ones:

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.100 	## [static IP of orange pi]
        netmask 255.255.255.0 	## [this will probably stay the same]
        gateway 192.168.1.1 	## [IP address of your router]
        dns-nameservers 75.75.75.75  ## [the dns that your router uses]

   If your Orange Pi does not have static IP (it is assigned by router dhcp), add this stanza

    auto eth0
    allow-hotplug eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

   Save the file. 

   Specify your router DNS server(s) in resolv.conf:
   root@orangepiprime:/etc/network# cd ..
   root@orangepiprime:/etc# cp resolv.conf resolv.conf.orig
   root@orangepiprime:/etc# nano resolv.conf
 
   Inside that file write:

   search lan
   nameserver 75.75.75.75   ## [the dns that your router uses]

   Save the file

   Now you can disable Network Manager and reboot the board:

   root@orangepiprime:/etc# cd ~
   root@orangepiprime:~# systemctl disable network-manager
   root@orangepiprime:~# shutdown
   You should wait a minute or so, and then go ahead and power recycle the Orange Pi.
   SSH back into the Pi and check to make sure that Network Manager does NOT appear on the list of processes:

   root@orangepiprime:~# ps -aux

5.  You can now install the linux-headers. First check your exact architecture:

   root@orangepiprime:~# uname -a 

   the part right after "Linux orangepiprime" should be "4.19.20-sunxi64"

   Update the repositories: 

   root@orangepiprime:~# apt-get update  

   Search to make sure that the linux headers you will need are available:
   root@orangepiprime:~# apt-cache search linux-headers 
   make sure you find in list:
   linux-headers-next-sunxi64 - Linux kernel headers for 4.19.20-sunxi64 on arm64

   If so, go ahead and install the headers:

   root@orangepiprime:~# apt-get install linux-headers-next-sunxi64
 
   Go look in /usr/src  now the correct headers should be there:
   root@orangepiprime:~# cd /usr/src
   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src# ls

6. Install some software needed to compile the driver:

    root@orangepiprime:/usr/src# cd ~
    root@orangepiprime:~# apt-get install mercurial bzr libgmp3-dev
    root@orangepiprime:~# apt-get install linux-kbuild-4.19

   The following should be up to date and not need to be installed, but if you want to be sure:
   root@orangepiprime:~# apt-get install binutils bison build-essential curl gcc git make

 
7. Get the mt7610u driver from github:

   root@orangepiprime:~# git clone https://github.com/FreedomDomains/mt7610u.git 

8. Go into the mt7610u folder, copy the Makefile (in case you hose it up) and add a line to specify your symvers file:

   root@orangepiprime:~# cd mt7610u 
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cp Makefile Makefile.orig
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# nano Makefile

   Inside the file, scroll down to the "WFLAGS" section (around line 72) and add this line before the WFLAGS declarations:

   KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS :=/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64/Module.symvers  

   Save the file.

   (note that if you have a different architecture, the "linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64" part may be different. If in doubt,
    go into "/usr/source" to see the exact name of the directory)


9. Before compiling, the header scripts need to be compiled. Leave current directory and go into headers directory, and
   type "make scripts"

   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cd ~
   root@orangepiprime:~# cd /usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64
   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64# make scripts

   If you are using the same architecture I used, you will get some errors including:

   scripts/kconfig/conf  --syncconfig Kconfig
   net/Kconfig:89: can't open file "net/wireguard/Kconfig"
   scripts/kconfig/Makefile:69: recipe for target 'syncconfig' failed

   You need to have Kconfig disregard the wireguard, which is not present. Go to "net" folder, copy Kconfig file (just in case):

   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64# cd net 
   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64/net# cp Kconfig Kconfig.orig
   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64/net# nano Kconfig  

   on line 89 comment out: 
   ## source "net/wireguard/Kconfig"

   Save file.

    Go back to the main headers folder, and "make scripts" again  (should work this time):

   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64/net# cd ..
   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64# make scripts

10.  Now it's time to go into the mt7610u driver folder and "make":

   root@orangepiprime:/usr/src/linux-headers-4.19.20-sunxi64# cd ~
   root@orangepiprime:~# cd mt7610u
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# make

   If you get errors about "redeclaration of enumerators, etc ..." that's because "mt7610u/include/rtmp.h"
   has declared variables which are also declared in headers, so those need to be commented out:

   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cd include
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u/include# cp rtmp.h rtmp.h.orig
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u/include# nano rtmp.h

  inside the file starting around line 5722  comment out this whole enum stanza:

 /*  enum ieee80211_radiotap_type { 

    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_TSFT = 0,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_FLAGS = 1,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_RATE = 2,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_CHANNEL = 3,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_FHSS = 4,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DBM_ANTSIGNAL = 5,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DBM_ANTNOISE = 6,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_LOCK_QUALITY = 7,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_TX_ATTENUATION = 8,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DB_TX_ATTENUATION = 9,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DBM_TX_POWER = 10,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_ANTENNA = 11,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DB_ANTSIGNAL = 12,
    IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_DB_ANTNOISE = 13 

 }; */

   Save the file. Go back to "mt7610u" folder and try again (should work this time):

   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u/include# cd ..
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# make
   

11. Install the firmware: 
.
   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# make installfw     

  (this will copy the firmware into your "/lib/firmware" directory.  these are the .bin files)

12. Copy the kernel module into the proper directory:

   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cp mt7610u.ko /lib/modules/4.19.20-sunxi64/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/

13. Enable the module:

   root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cd ~
   root@orangepiprime:~# depmod 4.19.20-sunxi64    
        
14. Time to reboot and go back in:

    root@orangepiprime:/etc/modprobe.d# cd ~
    root@orangepiprime:~# shutdown

    SSH back into board and enable mt7610u:

    root@orangepiprime:~# modprobe mt7610u   
    (IMPORTANT don't add the .ko)

   Check which modules are active:

   root@orangepiprime:~# lsmod

  should show mt7610u in list

15. Get the configuration file in the right place (/etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/RT2870STA.dat):
    Make directories:

    root@orangepiprime:~# cd /etc
    root@orangepiprime:/etc# mkdir Wireless
    root@orangepiprime:/etc# cd Wireless
    root@orangepiprime:/etc/Wireless# mkdir RT2870STA

   Go back to "mt7610u" folder and copy the .dat file into the path you just made:

    root@orangepiprime:/etc/Wireless# cd ~
    root@orangepiprime:~# cd mt7610u
    root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cp RT2870STA.dat /etc/Wireless/RT2870STA/
  
16. Make the config file for wpa_supplicant:

    root@orangepiprime:~/mt7610u# cd ~
    root@orangepiprime:~# cd /etc/wpa_supplicant
    root@orangepiprime:/etc/wpa_supplicant# nano wpa_supplicant.conf

    inside the file write:

    country=US    ## If outside US, use your country two digit code
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1

    network={
        ssid="mywifi"    ## use your actual router SSID
        key_mgmt=NONE
	mode=0
	scan_ssid=1
    }

   Save the file.

17. Shutdown the router:

    root@orangepiprime:/etc/wpa_supplicant# shutdown
    Completely shut off power supply, let the router rest a minute or two, then connect power and SSH back in.

18. Start up wpa_supplicant:

    root@orangepiprime:~# wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

   you should see the lines:
   wlan0: Trying to associate with 09:00:f0:78:6e:5c (SSID='MyWifi' freq=2462 MHz)
   wlan0: Associated with 09:00:f0:78:6e:5c
   wlan0: CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 09:00:f0:78:6e:5c completed

The usb stick should light up green

19. Don't do or type anything on this screen (it will break the connection) 
    Start a new putty session to connect (or if you use something like Tmux even better)

    From the new session, check the active interfaces:

    root@orangepiprime:~# ifconfig
     
    you should now see the interface "wlan0" besides the "eth0" and "lo"

    Check the active processes to make sure wpa_supplicant is running:

    root@orangepiprime:~# ps -aux

    If you have trouble getting wpa_supplicant running you can add the -dd flag to get debug information:

    wpa_supplicant -dd -Dnl80211 -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

20. To make sure your Orange Pi Prime is connected to your router wifi, use "iw": 

    root@orangepiprime:~# iw dev

       You should see something like:

   phy#0
        Interface wlan0
                ifindex 3
                wdev 0x1
                addr f7:de:42:8d:1e:6a
                ssid mywifi
                type managed
                txpower 12.00 dBm

    The "iw" commands can be used to scan and join other hotspots as well as a ton of other functionalities.
